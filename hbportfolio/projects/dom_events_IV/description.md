Similarly to the Dom Event III Project, this project is using JavaScript event listeners and the build-in JavaScript object "Math" to generate random colors and replacing existing colors, when a user click the elements. With extra help from the Event method stopPropagation(), the project showcases how it's possible to target specific HTML elements nested inside other HTML elements.

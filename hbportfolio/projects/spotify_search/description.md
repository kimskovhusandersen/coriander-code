This mini-projects involves the exploitation of Spotify's API, handlesbars, jQuery and JS Vanilla. The user are allowed to search for album or artist and gets a list of the 20 first results from Spotify in return.
If more results exist, the user can click the "more" button. The project also includes an infite scroll feature, which can be activate by adding "?scroll=infite" to the end of the querystring. It hides the "more" button and loads the next
20 results automatically, when the user scrolls to the bottom.
